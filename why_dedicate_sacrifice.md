Why I want to dedicate my life to build new technologies and learn more about 
the universe, and sacrifice my golden age for it, study and practice instead of
socializing, playing games, watching media, spending more time with family?

The answer is not an easy one. May be I just want to stand out, do not want to do
what others are already doing? May be, but this is only one part of the whole answer.
I wanna know everything, I wanna cure my mom, I wanna show to my family all of the
beautiful places, I wanna be that cool guy that is master in what he does, to hit 
or at least to be close to my human body limits, to make lives not only people but,of
all living organisms better. Everyone child, every teenager, every animal deserves 
to have parental love, support from society, needed nutrition, and opportunities to 
learn what he/she wants.
