Why I will be able to achieve success in IT?

The main reason of my believe in my success in Computer Science is my intriguing
finding after 3 years of programming experience. I think this is the most important
thing to understand for all programmers, especially for self-taught ones like me.
This concept is that most important thing to master in programming is not learning
trending and cutting edge new technologies and frameworks but to learn how to write
code, how to write clean, readable, efficient code. How to manage the complexity of
your files, how to use abstraction, how to write modular programs. 
I'm currently learning them, and I already see the improvement in my programs. 

Second reason of my success will be my ability to master nearly everything by
myself. Until today I have learned both school and college level science, math
by myself using a wonderful books. Same goes with programming, I am using all
free resources on the internet to learn it.

Third reason, I have a mac. I do not have to reinstall my Linux every other day,
and I do not have to wait to my Windows to update.


The main reason of my believe in my success in Computer Science is my (interesting,
astonishing, intriguing finding, which is in my humble opinion is the most important
thing to understand to become a true developer who not just merely uses tools created
by other developers but can build those tools by himself. And my finding
is that how many programming languages you know, how many frameworks you can use 
does not matters what matters is your style of thinking and coding. 
The ability to divide large problem into manageable chunks (modularity)
To be able to write a code that is easy to test
To be able to write a clean code
To understand how transistors make up logic gates, how logic gates make up CPU, how
CPU interacts with RAM and storage, how they interact with OS, how programming 
languages compile to executables.

Mean reason is that I was able to understand the most important thing in Programming.
And it's that if you haven't coded for 10k hours, then programming language you use
doesn't matters. It's all about your ability to write clean, readable, efficient, and
modular programs. You need to know the foundations. In order to truly understand
and to wisely use new technologies and frameworks So say hello to the guys that call
themselves - "I'm a X language developer". If someone says that he/she would be an
below average developer. Just a year ago, I would be rushing to learn trending and
cutting edge frameworks and technologies. But now I understand that most important thing
to do is just to practice writing 


The main reason of my believe in my success in Computer Science is, I think I come to 
understand after 3 years of my programming journey from a boy who cannot change keyboard
layout to a man that can write a fairly sophisticated programs, that in order to understand
and wisely use technologies and frameworks you (not just merely learn them)

Plot for a video

Interviewer with a white shirts and a tie asks the question
Then I talk about the main (serious) reason
At the end I say that the second reason is I have a MacBook and I don't have to wait
for updates to install.
Interviewer asks how many years of experience do you have using gargatuma library
I say 2 year of experience 
Interviewer rejects my application cause they require 5+ experience]
Screenshot from Wikipedia shows that gargatuma library was developed only two years ago.
